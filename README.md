At a high level if you wanted create a web page on github with an image; you will want to do 4 things.
   > Create an account Github

   > Add a 


Create an Account on Github
   To create an account on Github, you'll just 
     > go to github.com 
     > click "Sign Up" 
     > fill in any info you're asked for
     > validate your account via email (to activate)


Create a Repository
   Once you have your account, you can create a repository. To do so,
      > You'll log into your github account using the credentials you just created
      > Click Repositories *(at the top)
      > Click New (upper far right)
      > Give it name (ex. mwilms.github.io)


Create a folder on your local mac or pc
  Once you have a repository, you can add your code. To that you will want to
      > Create a folder (example folder name: mwilms.github.io)
           


Add your image
   Once you have your folder created, you will want to copy and paste an image to it. 
         -> I recommend using a photo that has .jpg extension (example photo name: photo.jpg)
         ->  I was also recommend using a photo in size 1GB or less (as github may not support the larger photo file sizes)
      
 
Add your code 
   Once you have an image in your folder, you can add your code. To that you will want to
      > Create an index.html file   (ex filename: index.html)
      > Add the below code to the index.html and save
          => Code: 
               <html>
                 <h1>Marcus's Portfolio</h1>
                 <img src="./photo.jpg" />
               </html>

        *** Side note: Your img src, should equql your photo name shown above ***
